# Bugs

### 01
- **Status:** [x] Fixed
- generating a provocation from selected text doesn't appear on side bar, probably because noteId is nil?

### 02
- **Status:** [ ] Not started
- when text is highlighted and overlay appears, I must click to exit the overlay before I can highlight new text. If I try to select new text while the overlay is present, nothing happens. Let’s modify this behavior so the user can immediately highlight new text 

### 03
- **Status:** [ ] Not started
- Tab name displays app name instead of document title

### 04
- **Status:** [ ] Not started
- click on quoted text in note. Text highlights. Overlay appears by the highlighted text (should not appear). Highlight the text without the overlay when selected from the note.
