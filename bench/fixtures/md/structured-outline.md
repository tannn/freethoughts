# Structured Outline

## Framing
A reading workflow needs context continuity, friction control, and recoverable note anchors.

## Evidence
1. Deterministic anchors improve re-import reliability.
2. Explicit uncertainty cues reduce overconfidence in summaries.

## Implications
Use constrained generation and preserve unresolved notes during revision shifts.
