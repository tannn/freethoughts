## Purpose

This constitution captures the technical standards and governance rules for
FreeThoughts. All features and pull requests should align with these principles.

## Technical Standards

### Languages and Frameworks
- **Swift** with **SwiftUI** for native macOS development
- Follow Apple's Swift API Design Guidelines
- Use modern Swift concurrency (async/await, actors) where appropriate

### Testing Requirements
- **XCTest** for all testing (unit, integration, UI)
- All features must have corresponding tests
- No strict coverage target, but reasonable coverage expected
- Critical paths (data persistence, core logic) should have thorough test coverage

### Performance and Scale
- **Smooth UI is paramount**: target 60fps for all animations and interactions
- App launch should be fast and responsive
- Avoid blocking the main thread; offload heavy work to background tasks
- Profile and address performance regressions before merging

### Deployment and Constraints
- **macOS only** native application
- Target current and recent macOS versions
- Direct distribution (not App Store, unless specified otherwise)
- No external runtime dependencies required for end users

## Governance

### Amendment Process
Any team member can propose amendments via pull request. Changes are discussed
and merged following standard PR review process.

### Compliance Validation
Code reviewers validate compliance during PR review. Constitution violations
should be flagged and addressed before merge.

### Exception Handling
Exceptions discussed case-by-case with team. Strong justification required.
Consider updating constitution if exceptions become common.
